# Scanner 3D Pro

A new Flutter project for 3D scanning.

### Presentation

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application designed to use a scanning solution with a Raspberry Pi and a few components, such as a camera and a linear laser. It manages the resulting files from the 3D modeling process and allows sharing these files after connecting to the Raspberry Pi via Wi-Fi.

#### Note

The project is under development. Your reviews or suggestions are welcome.
